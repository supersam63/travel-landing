              Dubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various
              architectural styles. Many modern interpretations of Islamic
              architecture can be found here, due to a boom in construction and
              architectural innovation in the Arab World in general, and in
              Dubai in particular. As a result of this boom, modern Islamic –
              and world – architecture has literally been taken to new levels in
              skyscraper building design and technology.

              Dubai has been called the "shopping capital of the Middle East".
              Dubai alone has more than 70 shopping centres, including the
              world's second largest shopping centre, Dubai Mall. Dubai is also
              known for the historical souk districts located on either side of
              its creek. Traditionally, dhows from East Asia, China, Sri Lanka,
              and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be
              bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks.

              the exciting adventures that await them when they, too, visit
              Dubai.
